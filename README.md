# Parabola
Parabola is intended to be a backend for cp2k to compute the normal modes, their energies and the linear electron-vibration/-phonon coupling constants. It provides apart from that other useful tools that utilize the analysis of electron-phonon coupled systems. 
## Prerequisites
python3: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, ctypes
c++: OpenMp

## Getting started
Up to now this is tested for Linux Ubuntu
The only really mandatory thing is to compile the c++ part of the program.
Just install all requirements (via apt), and compile the file...
